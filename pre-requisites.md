## Objective ##

In this lab, we'll be completing all the prerequisites for creating the Alexa Smart Home E2E Solution and generating the following parameters (needed in the following labs):

- MQTT Endpoint
- Github webApp respository URL
- Github access token

## Project Structure ##

The project repository has the following  structure

[1] This is the project root folder. 
[2] This is the root folder of the Lambda function.  
[3] This is the lambda function for sending asynchronous updates to Alexa
[4] This is the lambda function for responding to smart home skill directives
[5] This is the smart home skill lambda function. It receives directives from Alexa and sends responses back to Alexa.
[6] This lambda function authenticates requests sent to the lambda fucntions (a part of API gateway)
[7] Low level functions used across lambda functions to retrieve device data and user tokens
[8] This lambda function processes requests generated by the webApp
[9] This is the root folder for webApp
[10] This is the root folder for the simulated device
[11] Location where IoT device certificates will be stored
